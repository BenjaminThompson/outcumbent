# Outcumbent


Outcumbent is designed for the benefit of independents and minor-party candidates who want to advertise a track record even without having been in office. It is also for individuals who want to know how their own opinions compare to past or present incumbent politicians and their rivals in the minor-party/independent field.

The application is currently built using Python 2.7 and Django 1.5.

## The Problem


Incumbent politicians and parties have public voting records that can easily reveal how they are likely to vote in the future. Many voters make decisions based on these past votes. Sometimes a vote on a single piece of high-profile legislation decides the fate of the incumbent in a future election.

This high-visibility track record is an advantage over independents and minor-party candidates, whose lesser media penetration and lack of established history in office make it difficult for voters to know what to expect from them. It makes it difficult to visualize how the outsider candidate might have performed if he were in office instead of the incumbent.

## Outcumbent's Solution


Outcumbent provides a simple user interface for expressing and sharing a vote on a particular piece of legislation, or on links to web pages representing political topics.

Read-only accounts representing incumbents will have their votes recorded automatically when votes are available from government data sources.

Users can mine the data and build reports to compare the incumbents to the "outcumbents" or compare any two user vote histories to each other. More flexible reporting may come later.
